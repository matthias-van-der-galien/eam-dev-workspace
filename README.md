# EAM Dev Workspace

This repository is a unified workspace that hosts the EAM platform frontend and backend side-by-side. The goal is to let an AI agent (or a developer) edit both codebases in a single place, keeping changes coordinated across the stack.

## What is inside

- `frontend/` - Next.js web application (see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)).
- `backend/` - NestJS API and worker services (see [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)).

## When to use this workspace

- You want to make a change that touches both UI and API.
- You want shared context (docs, tests, config) while editing in parallel.
- You are running the app locally with the frontend and backend together.
